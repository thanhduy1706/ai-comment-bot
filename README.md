## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Bot fails to post comments.

**Solution:**

- Ensure you're logged into Facebook. If prompted, follow the manual login steps.
- Check the `logs/` directory for detailed error messages.
- Update the `COMMENT_BOX_XPATH` in the `CONFIG` if Facebook has updated its UI.

**Issue:** "element click intercepted" error persists.

**Solution:**

- Enhance the `close_overlays` method to handle new pop-ups or overlays.
- Implement additional delays to ensure elements are fully loaded.
- Use more robust selectors to accurately locate the comment box.

**Issue:** Unable to locate comment box.

**Solution:**

- Verify the `COMMENT_BOX_XPATH` in the `CONFIG`.
- Update the XPath based on the current Facebook UI.
- Ensure that Facebook hasn't changed the structure or labels of the comment box.
